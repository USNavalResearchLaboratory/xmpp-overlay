  polling-based discovery mechanism. Removed DiscoverableClient as an
  INDI advertisement. 
+ Very rudimentary gatewaying on linux 
+ Configurable bind multicast address for ProtoSD/INDI in Android and

+ Android support
* gatewayed MUC rooms untested


[XOP 0.8.3]
+ supports gatewayed MUC rooms
+ supports video and voice chat
+ supports one-to-one messaging between remote clients
+ XOP works on Android
+ Clients can exchange datagrams using UDP directly
+ Each muc room can have different TransportEngine settings
+ new service discovery architecture that allows for a variety of SD implementations
+ Discovery, a UDP heartbeat service discovery implementation
+ Properties can be accessed using "XOP.PROPERTY" syntax
- No longer uses the component architecture
- No longer uses the packet filter architecture
- IQManager doesn't spin off unnecessary threads
* PacketRouter, RosterManager, PresenceManager, SDPresenceManager --consolidated--> ClientManager
* Replaced MUC component with RoomManagers


[XOP 0.8.1 2013-06-17]
+ have enterprise clients connected via XOG advertise presence and
MUC occupants joins or leaves MUC rooms.
+ clients in the MANET are bridged into MUC rooms on enterprise openfire
side.
+ enterprise clients show up in roster list once any MANET client adds
the enterprise client to his/her roster list.
* running XOP requires a built version and reference to the transport
engine.
* MUC component is no longer a jar component that is loaded by
reflection-based autoloader.

[XOP 0.8 2013-03-15]
 * XO no longer uses a config file by default.  You can generate one with the
   script included in bin/, if you would like to use one.
 * XO now loads the server advertisement component when configured to do so
 * Support for transport engine with persistence turned off by default
 artf1469: Asymmetric Roster Lists
 artf1472: XOP Client Rosters and MUC Room occupant lists not updated
 artf1474: XOP CPU utilization issue with the /coreapps milcom demo
 artf1475: Concurrent modification Exception when running XOP MILCOM demo
 artf1476: MUC room occupants does not update when clients leave then return
 artf1477: MUC room occupants cannot receive messages until they send a message
 artf1478: Roster list shows logged out clients when re-logging back in.
 artf1479: multiple XOP instances in linear topology does not forward MUC messages (smf is running)
 artf1480: XOP will re-advertise discovered rooms
 artf1481: XOP with integrated ProtoSD does not bind to multiple interfaces
 artf1483: muc occupant on some clients do not update when occupant leaves room
 
[XOP 0.7 2013-01-22]
 * XO now uses the transport engine exclusively for all non-local network
   communications.  GUMP is no longer being used.
 * XO uses the latest version of ProtoSD for service discovery
 * Fixed artf1468:  XO no longer hangs when quitting.  You can type "exit" in
   the text controller ("clean" shutdown, sends goodbye messages, etc), or
   <ctrl>-c (immediate shutdown).
 * Removed packet viewer window, since we can't port this to Android, and we
   don't use it anyway.  Use pidgin debug mode if you want to view packets.
 * A lot of general code cleanup.  Deleted unused variables, removed useless
   control statements, unused classes and functions, fixed "broken" comments,
   etc.
