<h1>ProtoSD REST API</h1>


<p>ProtoSD embeds a minimal Web server implementation based on Jersey's simple Web server implementation,
    which has been extended to do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>HTTPS:</b> for supporting secure connections </li>
    <li><b>Server side includes:</b> for integrating files on the server side for convenience</li>
    <li><b>Mime support:</b> for supporting several mime types, including image types (jpg, png, etc), css,
        javascript and php. With these extensions, the Web server can load in most Web content.</li>
    <li><b>Extended WADL Support:</b> for generating dynamic WADL interfaces to be found at
        "/application.wadl" that include the javadoc comments from the Java source code..</li>
</ol>

<p>The REST API uses this Web server implement and integrates the Jersey REST toolkit, which is an
    implementation of the JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. Jersey essentially provided annotations extended
    from JAXB for the REST verbs required to create REST implementations.  The use of annotations is
    interesting because it encourages stateless server side implementation, an essential feature for
    creating scalable REST applications.</p>

<h2>ProtoSD High level Rest Functionality</h2>

<p>ProtoSD supports the following functionality:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Dynamic Service Discovery System (SDS) Instantiation:</b> you can create, edit and delete
                instances of the JmDNS and INDI service discovery discovery systems using the API.</li>
            <li><b>Service Advertisements:</b> ProtoSD supports the creations of new service for
                advertisement and provides support for all associated metadata required for creating
            complex service advertisements for the particular environment being deployed into. It also
                supports service deletion</li>
            <li><b>Service Discovery:</b> all services are discovered according to the settings of the
            discovery system being used. The REST API provides multiple methods for searching
            the discovered services for fine tuning the results and providing rapid access to the the
                types of services you are interested in. There are also multiple levels of service
                representation for a high level view or a in depth look at all of the associated
            parameters.</li>
        </ol>

<p>These three sections are covered in more detail in each section on the menu.</p>

<h1>Specifying The Content Type</h1>

        <p>You can specify the payload type and the return type for the messages by using the header's content-type and accept header:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Content-type:</b> by setting 'Content-Type': 'application/xml' you will be able to
            send XML to the POST or PUT operations and setting the 'Content-Type': 'application/json' would allow
            you to set a JSON payload.</li>
            <li><b>Accept:</b> by setting 'Accept': 'application/xml' in the http header you tell the Web API to
            return XML and 'Accept': 'application/json' will force it to return JSON.</li>
        </ol>
