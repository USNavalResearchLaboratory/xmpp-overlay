\section*{Acknowledgments}

INDI work has been funded in part by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Service Oriented Networks Operating in MANET (SONOMA) project.  Work in developing  mDNS interpoperability has been supported in part by the Groupwise Tactical Edge networking (GTEN) effort under “Networks Programs” within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD), Research and Engineering. The authors wish like to thank Brian Adamson for his advice and SMF implementation used as an experimentation tool. We would also like to thank Andrew Harrison and Justin Dean for their work on the initial INDI implementation and experimentation efforts.  Finally, we would  like to thank the JmDNS team, and in particular, Pierre Frisch, who provided insight, guidance and exposed the timing interfaces for JmDNS tasks that made this work possible.
