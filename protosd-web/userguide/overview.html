<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>ProtoSD is a discovery system that can be used to advertise and discover services
    on a network.   The system builds on mDNS by using the same service definitions
    that are defined using the familiar Bonjour or mDNS style and abstracts these to
    various discovery implementations for advertisement on the network.  Previous versions
    included bindings to SLP but more recently we moved mDNS more central to the API
    and ProtSd now supports JmDNS and INDI. INDI is effectively an overlay for mDNS
    that adapts it for use in multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) network
    environments.</p>


<p> ProtoSD was designed as a discovery toolkit for exposing the raw functionality of
    the underlying discovery system and to provide higher level interfaces for
    consumption by users and programmers.  A key focus during all of this development
    was to support MANET deployment for more distributed, serverless service discovery.
    Due to the disruptive nature of the MANET environment, deploying survivable
    group-oriented applications and enterprise
    services across such network infrastructures requires a more flexible approach to
    service discovery than typically provided by conventional design for more fixed
    network operation.  ProtoSD therefore attempts to provide a toolkit that can
    seamlessly integrate with existing applications (through the use of bonjour)
    and at the same time, allow the same API to bridge into discovery protocols
    intended for MANETs.</p>

<h2>ProtoSD Discovery Protocols</h2>

<p>ProtoSD currently supports two discovery protocols:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> <b>Multicast DNS</b> (mDNS) is a joint effort between the IETF Zero Configuration
                Networking (zeroconf) and DNS Extensions (dnsext) working
                groups<a href="#references"><sup>1</sup></a> and
                provides a way of using familiar DNS programming interfaces, packet formats and
                operating semantics, in a small network where no conventional DNS server has been
                installed, through the use of multicast to perform DNS queries.  Clients perform DNS-like
                queries for DNS-like resource records by sending UDP query and  packets using IP
                Multicast on UDP port 5353.  We use the Java implementation of mDNS (JmDNS <a href="#references"><sup>2</sup></a>).</p>
            </li>
            <li> The <b>INdependent Discovery Interface (INDI)</b> is a discovery system supporting
                operational modes suitable for use in multi-hop mobile wireless networks. To
                this end, INDI supports three broad discovery modes that allow it to operate
                reactively, proactively or a combination of both. It also employs the use of
                timers that can be adjusted to the mobile scenario at hand.  INDI is built on the
                JmDNS stack and therefore support the identical lower-layer network messaging packets
                and DNS interfaces.  INDI therefore is  JmDNS compatible in terms of interface
                and since JmDNS is fully compatible with Apple Bonjour, INDI also can be used to
                interoperate with Bonjour and mDNS.</p>
           </li>
        </ol>


<p>ProtoSD exposes a command-line tools that provides the same interface as DNS-SD, the Apple
    command-line tool for Bonjour.


<h2>Bonjour and mDNS</h2>

<p>Bonjour is Apple's implementation of Zeroconf, a service discovery protocol, which provides a
    generic method of discovering services on a local area network. It is widely used throughout
    Mac OS X and allows users to set up a network without any configuration. Apple make widespread
    use of it in Mac OS X to find printers, file-sharing servers, shared music (iTunes), shared
    photos (iPhoto) and so forth.  Various vendors have also adopted the method to advertise their
    network services e.g. Adobe Systems Creative Suite 3, Proteus, Adium, Fire, Pidgin, Skype,
    Vine Server, and Elgato EyeTV to share local recordings with multiple clients, the Gizmo5 to
    find other users on the local network, TiVo Desktop to find digital video recorders and
    shared-media libraries and OmniFocus to synchronize projects and tasks across the Mac desktop
    and the iPhone or iPod touch, to name a few.</p>

<p>On the mac it is also used by the Safari browser to find local web servers and configuration
    pages for local devices. Proto-SD takes advantage of this by advertising itself using bonjour
    so that Safari (and other browsers) can discover its instances dynamically using their browser
    bonjour plugin.</p>

<p>Bonjour works within a single broadcast domain, which is usually a small area, without
    special DNS configuration. Apple  made the source code of the Bonjour multicast DNS responder
    (mDNS), the core component of service discovery, available as a Darwin open source
    project. The project provides source code to build the responder daemon for a wide range of
    platforms, including Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, Solaris, VxWorks, and Windows. There
    are also mDNS interoperable implementations in other languages, such as JmDNS, for Java.</p>
