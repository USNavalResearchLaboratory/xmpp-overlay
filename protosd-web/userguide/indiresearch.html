<h1>INDI Underlying Research </h1>

<p>This section provides a rif overview of some of the research papers and results that led to the development of
    INDI</p>

<p>In this paper, we published results to show that different combinations of service providers and
    consumers led to significantly different service requirements within a MANET environment . This led to a
    prototype implementation of our Independent Network Discovery Interface (INDI) that addressed
    these concerns by providing three different profiles and flexible configuration parameters for
    applying bespoke timers and multicast distribution policies for these different mobile scenarios. </p>

    <p>In this paper, we discussed the adaptation of this implementation to work alongside mDNS to address the
    MANET architectural considerations and for maintaining full interoperabil-ity with existing mDNS
    enterprise deployments (e.g. Apple Bonjour, etc). We also provided a functional empirical analysis
    of JmDNS, Bonjour and INDI mDNS when discovering single services on a LAN and showed that INDI
    can have up to a twelvefold reduction in network messages over these existing protocols when
    discovering a single service on a LAN  mainly because of the fixed nature of the mDNS timer scheme.</p>

    <p>In this more recent work , we performed a set of 96 CORE emulations to compare the performance
        of INDI with JmDNS on a mobile network. We triggered 10 second Poisson interval service
        events onto the network from one service provider to 9 consumers over a 260 second
        emulation. The mobility patterns were generated using an ns-2 mobility pattern generator and
        then imported into CORE using its inbuilt ns-2 mobile script importer. The emulation runs for
        250 seconds and for mobility purposes, the nodes where split into two distinct groups with 5
        nodes per group: the first group containing consumers 1-4 and the producer; and the second
        containing consumers 5-9 inclusively. . The network fragmented four times during the
        emulation.  the Figure below shows the results from this experiment.</p>

        <p>The results in the above Figure show the success rates for INDI and JmDNS when required to
        satisfy a defined Quality of Service (QoS) criteria, specified as the maximum number of seconds:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                A service is required to be discovered
            </li>
            <li>
                A service is discovered to be no longer available
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>At more stringent levels of QoS (when required to discover a service within 1 second and
            discover its departure within 2 seconds), JmDNS failed to discover any services, whereas
            INDI achieved success rates of 83%. Increasing the QoS requirements to a 2 second discovery
            and 5 second departure, showed results of around 40% for JmDNS and 100% for INDI.   The poor
            performance of JmDNS can be explained  by the significantly different design priorities
            for mDNS when discovering services. Rather than dealing with responsiveness, it performs
            multiple queries in order to ensure the discovery of the new longer lived services
            but also, it attempts to deal with maintaining the state of IP addresses in case of
            conflicts. This extra level of state maintenance creates an extra overhead on the
            network that introduces more traffic and a longer delay in the initial discovery. This
            is therefore not a failing of JmDNS but rather a mismatch of its intended purpose.
            However, it does stress the importance on the level of configurability for offering
            flexible modes and timers that INDI strives to achieve. In these experiments, INDI
            also consumed a third of the traffic overhead than JmDNS, mainly due to the multiple
            messages sent out for each mDNS advertisement.</p>
