\title{XO Features Checklist}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This document contains a table of features that XO should support.  Before a
new version of XO is tagged out, each of these features should be tested to
ensure that it works.  This document assumes that the version of the Transport
Engine being used with it is working properly.

When new features are added to XO, they should be added to the table below.

The document uses the term ``client'' to refer to an XMPP client.  Obviously
testing all XMPP clients is not feasible.  Therefore, testing all of the
features with just pidgin is acceptable, provided that the red green demo also
works.

For all of the ``remote'' features, they should be tested with at least one
intermediary node, to ensure the feature works over multiple hops.

\noindent \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{7.25cm}|r|} \hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Status} \\ \hline

Plaintext Client Connection & A client can log in to XO using no encryption. &
    \\ \hline

Secure Client Connection & A client can log in to XO using encrpytion. & \\
    \hline

Interface Binding & A client binds to the specified interface (eth0, lo, etc)
    & \\ \hline

XOP Forward Gateway & \texttt{xog} and \texttt{s2s} are loaded, and connect to 
    an Openfire Server when a message is sent.  To test if it is connected,
    look at the OpenFire admin panel.& \\ \hline

XOG <-> XOG & An instance of \texttt{xog} and \texttt{s2s} are loaded on two 
    different XO clouds, and are able to pass messages between them. To test if
    it is connected, look at the log messages.& \\ \hline

Non-Persistence & When persistence is set to 0, messages are not persisted. & \\
    \hline

Persistence & When persistence is set to 1, messages are persisted forever. & \\
    \hline

Local Roster List & When an client connects to an XO instance that already has
    a client connected to it, both clients see each other in the ``Local'' roster
    list. & \\ \hline

Remote Roster List & When an client connects to an XO instance, and another
    client is connected to another XO instance on the same MANET, both clients 
    see each other in the ``Remote'' roster list. & \\ \hline

Local Messaging & Two clients connect to the same XO instance, and each joins
    the same chatroom.  Each sends a message to the chatroom, and each message 
    appears in the sender's and receiver's chat window. & \\ \hline

Remote Messaging & Two clients connect to two different XO instances on the
    same MANET, and each joins the same chatroom.  Each sends a message to the
    chatroom, and each message appears in the sender's and receiver's chat 
    window. & \\ \hline

Local Room Query & Client A connects to XO and joins chatroom ``foo''.  Client
B connects to the same XO instance, and queries for a list of available rooms.
Room ``foo'' should appear in the list. & \\ \hline

Remote Room Query & Client A connects to XO and joins chatroom ``foo''.
    Client B connects to a different XO instance on the same MANET, and queries
    for a list of available rooms.  Room ``foo'' should appear in the list. 
        & \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\noindent \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{7.25cm}|r|} \hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Status} \\ \hline

XO Shutdown & When using the text controller (default), typing 'exit' at the
    command line shuts down XO within a reasonable amount of time (a few 
    seconds on a typical computer) & \\ \hline

Killing It & When using the text controller (default), pressing "<ctrl>-c"
    kills XO instantly. & \\ \hline

Server Advertisement & When the \texttt{ad} is loaded, XO should advertise
    itself over mDNS as an XMPP server. & \\ \hline

Local Presence & When two clients are logged into the same instance of XO,
    they should see each others presence status (free-text) and mode (away,
    available, etc) in the roster list. & \\ \hline

Remote Presence & When two clients are logged into different instances of XO on
    the same MANET, they should see each others presence status (free-text) and
    mode (away, available, etc) in the roster list. & \\ \hline

XOP Gateway Forwarding & Have XO load \texttt{s2s} and \texttt{xog}, and
    connect it to an OpenFire server.  Connect a chat client to the OpenFire
    server.  Connect another client to the XO instance.  Have each client send
    a message.  Do both clients see both messages? & \\ \hline
